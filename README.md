## üö¶ Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+ 
- npm or yarn
- Supabase account (for backend services)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone [repository-url]
   cd vision-board-bliss
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Set up environment variables**
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env.local
   ```
   
   Add your Supabase credentials:
   ```env
   VITE_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url
   VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key
   ```

4. **Start the development server**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

5. **Open your browser**
   Navigate to `http://localhost:8080`

### Database Setup

The application requires a Supabase database with the following table:

```sql
CREATE TABLE user_goals (
  id UUID DEFAULT gen_random_uuid() PRIMARY KEY,
  user_id UUID REFERENCES auth.users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  image TEXT,
  description TEXT NOT NULL,
  why TEXT,
  deadline DATE NOT NULL,
  achieved BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE,
  achieved_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE,
  created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW(),
  updated_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW()
);

-- Enable Row Level Security
ALTER TABLE user_goals ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- Create policies for user data isolation
CREATE POLICY "Users can view own goals" ON user_goals
  FOR SELECT USING (auth.uid() = user_id);

CREATE POLICY "Users can insert own goals" ON user_goals
  FOR INSERT WITH CHECK (auth.uid() = user_id);

CREATE POLICY "Users can update own goals" ON user_goals
  FOR UPDATE USING (auth.uid() = user_id);

CREATE POLICY "Users can delete own goals" ON user_goals
  FOR DELETE USING (auth.uid() = user_id);
```
