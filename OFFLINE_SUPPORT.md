# Offline Support for Vision Board Bliss

This document explains the offline capabilities implemented in Vision Board Bliss.

## Features

- **View Goals Offline**: All your goals are cached locally and available even without an internet connection
- **Offline Indicators**: Clear visual indicators show when you're working in offline mode
- **Offline Actions**: Add, edit, delete, and mark goals as achieved even when offline
- **Automatic Synchronization**: Changes made offline will be synchronized when you reconnect

## How It Works

### Service Worker

A service worker caches application assets (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) to ensure the application loads even without an internet connection.

### Local Storage

Goals are stored in the browser's local storage, allowing you to:
- View your existing goals when offline
- Make changes that will be synchronized when you reconnect

### Online/Offline Detection

The application automatically detects your connection status and:
- Shows clear indicators when you're working offline
- Provides informative messages about offline functionality
- Switches data sources between the server and local storage as needed

## Technical Implementation

The offline support is implemented through several key components:

1. **Service Worker**: Caches application assets and handles offline requests
2. **Local Storage Utilities**: Manages goal data in the browser's local storage
3. **Online Status Detection**: Monitors network connectivity changes
4. **Offline-Aware Components**: UI components that adapt to online/offline status
5. **Data Synchronization**: Logic to reconcile offline changes with the server

## Limitations

While offline mode provides extensive functionality, there are some limitations:

- Images that haven't been previously loaded might not be available offline
- New goals created offline will have temporary IDs until synchronized
- Complex operations like sharing achievements require an internet connection

## Future Enhancements

Planned improvements to offline support:

- Background synchronization when connection is restored
- Conflict resolution for changes made to the same goal online and offline
- Offline image caching for better visual experience
- Push notifications when offline changes are successfully synchronized
